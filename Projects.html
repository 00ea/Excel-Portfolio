<h2>Project 1</h2>
<p style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgb(203, 241, 245) 65%, black); color: transparent; background-clip: text;">
   One of my favourite projects was during my 1st year 2nd semester Networking course.
   We were tasked with creating an entire networking system for 3 buildings that were connected via
   a single router. From configuring the IP addresses to making sure each device could communicate with
   each other, this project was all around engaging. The best part about it was the finished product
   in which every single device could ping each other. This really helped improve my critical thinking skills
   since it required extensive focus to be completed.

<h2 style="color: black;">Project 2</h2>
<p style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgb(203, 241, 245) 65%, gray); color: transparent; background-clip: text;">
   The hardest project I've done was somewhat similar to the previous project, but with much more
   devices  to configure as well as extra tasks. Not only did we have to create the entire network,
   but we also had to configure static IP's so that the devices could connect to remote servers. This
   was the most challenging because there were so many errors throughout, but at the end of the day, it
   was a great learning experience for me and my partners. It taught me a lot about networking, collaboration,
   and most of all, problem solving.

<h2>Project 3</h2>
<p style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgb(203, 241, 245) 80%, black); color: transparent; background-clip: text;">
   This project was one I found really fun to do and it allowed me to really find my love for coding.
   At the time it seemed difficult, but looking back now, I realise it was relatively simple. We were 
   tasked with creating a student ledger that displays details about students. This included a login page,
   a menu page, as well as the information page. The students would enter their information, and the system
   would save it to a local database. This way, anytime it was to be accessed, it can be pulled from the database.
   This was and is still one of the coolest projects I've done as it had real-world application and proved how easy
   it is to code such complex looking things.

<h2 style="color: black;">Project 4</h2>
<p style="background-image: linear-gradient(rgb(203, 241, 245) 80%, gray); color: transparent; background-clip: text;">
   A project that I still use till this day would be the grade calculator we were assigned to make in high school.
   In my final year of highschool, we were given a project to create absolutely anything we wanted, as long as it followed
   a specific set of rules. I chose to create a grade calculator that calculated averages, and my favourite part, how much you'd
   need to score on an exam to get the grade you want. Obviously there are sites that do it better like Calculator.net, but the one
   I made really was monumental for me because I managed to code it from complete scratch. This really gave me confidence to pursue
   coding at a higher level and had quite an impact on my major in University.
