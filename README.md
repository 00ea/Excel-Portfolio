What color scheme did you choose for your website and why?
#Color Scheme

I chose a light blue shade color scheme for my website because not only is it one of my favourite colors, but it also encompasses my personality. The color light blue symbolizes tranquility, calm and peace. I'm a really shy guy who likes his peace. I don't really like drama or confrontations because I prefer a more relaxed atmoshpere. This light blue really represents that, which is why I chose this shade for my color scheme.
