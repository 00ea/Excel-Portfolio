<h1>About Me Page</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Excel. I am a 2nd year student at Ontario Tech University! 
   I love playing games, watching shows/movies, and reading novels and manga!
   I'm a pretty chill, introverted guy so if I ever seem awkward, thats why.</p>

<h3>Project 1</h3>
<p>
   One of my favourite projects was during my 1st year 2nd semester Networking course.
   We were tasked with creating an entire networking system for 2 buildings that were connected via
   a single router. From configuring the IP addresses to making sure each device could communicate with
   each other, this project was all around engaging. The best part about it was the finished product
   in which every single device could ping each other. This really helped improve my critical thinking skills
   since it required extensive focus to be completed.

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>
   The hardest project I've done was somewhat similar to the previous project, but with much more
   devices to configure as well as extra tasks. Not only did we have to create the entire network,
   but we also had to configure static IP's so that the devices could connect to remote servers. This
   was the most challenging because there were so many errors throughout, but at the end of the day, it
   was a great learning experience for me and my partners. It taught me a lot about networking, collaboration,
   and most of all, problem solving.
