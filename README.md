# **Excel's Portfolio**

This website is essentially a digital embodiment of me, Excel Aibangbee. From the color schemes to the projects and videos, this really portrays my life in digital form. I put a lot of effort into making this an engaging experience for all that wish to learn more about my life and journey.

# **Linear and Angle Linear Gradient**

I used linear gradients on my project and about me pages. I tried it out on one page, and it turned out amazing, so I started experimenting and ended up using it only on the text boxes. The initial plan was to implement it on all my footers, but it seemed really lackluster, so I decided to make it strictly on text boxes. I especially like how it blends in and fades out.

# **Color Scheme**

I chose a light blue / gray shade color scheme for my website because not only is it one of my favourite colors, but it also encompasses my personality. The color light blue symbolizes tranquility, calm and peace, while the color gray symbolizes balance and compromise. I'm a really shy guy who likes his peace and is willing to make compromises to keep my peace. I don't really like drama or confrontations because I prefer a more relaxed atmoshpere. This light blue really represents that, which is why I chose this shade for my color scheme.
